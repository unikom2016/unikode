-You don't have to specified the height of the marquee directly, so it will determines default position instead.
For effect like collide together

-Reason why the marquee text didn't have "new line" when specified the width?
by default, the width is 100%, so it'll take as much space available and create a new line for second marquee :))

-Thanks to Ala Rai, gives me insight to declare the center point directly in HTML using tag "width=50%"
